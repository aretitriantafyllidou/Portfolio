# UNICEF NL — Social Media Engagement (Case Study)

**Goal**  
Predict what drives engagement (reactions, comments, and shares) in UNICEF NL’s social media posts by combining text and image analytics with machine learning.

---

**Tech Stack**  
 R • Random Forest • Linear Regression • Power BI • Python (color & luminance extraction)

---

**Highlights**  
- **Factual > Emotional:** factual framing drives higher engagement.  
- **Negative framing ↑:** especially effective for shares.  
- **Warm colors perform better**, while medium luminance underperforms.  
- **Organic > Sponsored:** sponsored posts reduce engagement.  
- **Momentum effect:** previous-week engagement strongly predicts next-week results.
