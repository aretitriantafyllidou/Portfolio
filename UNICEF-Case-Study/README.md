# Social Media Engagement Analysis for UNICEF NL

**Goal**  
This project analyzes 1,645 social media posts from UNICEF Netherlands to identify the key factors driving audience engagement by combining text and image analytics with machine learning. We provide actionable insights to optimize content strategy across Facebook and Instagram

**Tech Stack**  
 R • Random Forest • Linear Regression • Power BI • Python (color & luminance extraction)

---

**Highlights**  
- **Factual > Emotional:** factual framing drives higher engagement.  
- **Negative framing increases engagement:** especially effective for shares.  
- **Warm colors perform better**, while medium luminance underperforms.  
- **Organic > Sponsored:** sponsored posts reduce engagement.  
- **Momentum effect:** previous-week engagement strongly predicts next-week results.
